## 3. Coding Standards

### General Coding Practices

- **Next.js Best Practices**: Ensure your application is production-ready by following [Next.js Best Practices](https://nextjs.org/docs).
- **Readable Code**: Write clean, readable, and modular code. Follow consistent naming conventions, proper indentation, and logical file organization.
- **Document Your Work**: Every feature or component should have clear comments or inline documentation, especially if it involves complex logic.

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- **TypeScript is preferred**: Always use strict type-checking to avoid runtime errors.
- **Avoid Anti-Patterns**: Do not use outdated JavaScript practices or anti-patterns that could compromise maintainability or performance.

### Styling

- Use **TailwindCSS** for all CSS styling needs.
- Use **ShadCN** for beautifully designed components.

### UI/UX

- Ensure the interface is fully responsive and generated by **v0.dev**. Consistency in design and usability is critical.

### Testing

- Test your code thoroughly before submission. This includes functionality, edge cases, and responsiveness.

## 4. Code Review and Submission Process

- **High Standards Are Mandatory**: Only submit code that adheres to these guidelines. Submissions that deviate from these standards will be rejected outright.
- **Self-Review First**: Before submitting, test and review your code thoroughly to ensure it meets all requirements.
- **Code Reviews**: We operate on peer code reviews. Be ready to defend your decisions and incorporate feedback.
